## Hi there 👋


Hello there, I am Ayan(sometimes nicknamed Nyan by my friends) and I am an undergraduate student studying Biotechnology. I am also into writing poetry, debating and ranting about anime and Real Madrid in my free time.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python

🌕 I'm currently working on Project Mongol Tori

😄 Pronouns: anything works

⚡ Fun fact: I like cats a lot and the second thing I love the most is LaTeX
